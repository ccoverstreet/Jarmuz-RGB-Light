# Jarmuz-RGB-Light
Author: Cale Overstreet

A Jablko Mod (JMOD) for [ccoverstreet/Jablko](https://github.com/ccoverstreet/Jablko) that communicates to WiFi-connected RGB lights with ESP8266-based boards running a UDP client

## Status

This mod is the first test for using the upcoming Jablko 0.3.0 framework. The actual ESP8266 based UDP clients haven't been designed yet and Jablko still needs some polishing and API documentation before this is ready for any form of release.
